Reflection
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project began as a simple CRUD app but evolved into a poetic interface for storytelling through books. I focused on modularity, accessibility, and emotional resonance—ensuring each UI element felt intentional and expressive.
What I learned:
• 	How to structure Express routes for clarity and scalability
• 	DOM manipulation for dynamic rendering and modal logic
• 	Validating user input across frontend and backend
• 	Creating responsive layouts with Tailwind
• 	Debugging event listeners and asynchronous fetch logic
What I’m proud of:
• 	The modal-based UX that keeps the interface clean and focused
• 	The rating system with visual feedback and backend validation
• 	The cosmic-themed design that reflects my artistic vision
• 	Writing clear documentation and UML diagrams to support maintainability
Next steps:
• 	Add genre-based icons and animations
• 	Integrate analytics dashboard for reading trends
• 	Expand documentation with visual diagrams and API reference

Background
The background image is a bookshelf layered with stars, symbolizing the constellation of stories we carry. It sets the tone for a library that’s not just functional—but magical.
